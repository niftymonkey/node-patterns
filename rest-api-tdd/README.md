# RESTful API development with TDD

These examples illustrate a Test Driven Development setup for building RESTful APIs with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
and [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## TDD modules

The testing modules used for this are [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/),
[Expect](https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js/), and [SuperAgent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/)


This first pass is loosely based on examples in the [Express Guide](http://expressjsguide.com/)
